    access, the Licensee agrees to the following terms:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">1. Licensee, Authorized Users.</strong> A Licensee
    must be a HITRUST Qualified Organization or Qualified Individual, which
    includes organizations and/or individuals employing a function or activity
    involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health
    information or individually identifiable personal information, provided such
    organization and/or individual does not provide security products or
    services of any kind or nature. Federal, state, and/or local governmental
    organizations or employees acting in an official capacity are Authorized
    Users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is a non-exclusive list of persons or entities that are NOT
    HITRUST Qualified Organizations and/or HITRUST Qualified Individuals and

  <p>
    You may NOT accept the terms and conditions of this License Agreement and
    access the HITRUST CSF or any portion thereof if you are not a HITRUST
    Qualified Organization and/or a HITRUST Qualified Individual. If a
    Licensee’s status as a HITRUST Qualified Organization and/or a HITRUST
    Qualified Individual is revoked or terminated, HITRUST may, in its sole and
    absolute discretion, terminate the License and revoke Licensee’s
    authorization to have downloaded and to utilize the HITRUST CSF.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Licensee may authorize unlimited individual users, provided that each
    authorized user is a Qualified Individual and has a need to use the HITRUST
    CSF to provide internal services or perform internal functions for the
    Licensee, subject to this License Agreement (“Authorized Users”). The
    Licensee shall always maintain a list of all current and past Authorized
    Users. Authorized Users may include both employees of the Licensee or its
    Affiliates and their agents. All Authorized Users are subject to this
    License Agreement and Licensee shall not permit disclosure of an electronic
    or paper copy, in whole or part, of the HITRUST CSF, to any other person or
    entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon termination of an Authorized User’s authorization under this License
    Agreement for any reason, the Licensee shall (a) revoke the individual’s
    access to the HITRUST CSF, (b) remove any such electronic files from the
    individual’s possession and from all computers, systems, and devices to
    which the individual has access, and (c) remove any paper copies of the
    HITRUST CSF from the individual’s possession. In the case of a potential
    breach of this Agreement by one or more Authorized User(s), Licensee shall
    cooperate with HITRUST to identify the relevant user(s) and to remedy or
    remediate any breach. Licensee acknowledges that this may require sharing
    personal data about one or more Authorized User(s) with HITRUST and hereby
    acknowledges that it is responsible for getting proper consent as needed
    from potential Authorized Users to share such information with HITRUST prior
    to providing the proposed user access to the HITRUST CSF.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">2. Grant of License.</strong> Subject to compliance

    of this License Agreement, HITRUST shall make portions of the HITRUST CSF
    available to Licensee for delivery by the Internet from the server(s) on

    <strong class="c-red">6. Updates.</strong> Licensor may, in its sole
    discretion, update the HITRUST CSF, by which Licensee would be entitled to
    the updated version of the HITRUST CSF, in which case such updates shall be

    <li>
      Create any Derivative Work, based in whole or part on any portion of the

      Work” as used herein shall mean any service, software program or other
      work, and copies thereof, which are developed by Licensee, or its
      Affiliates, and which are based on or incorporate any part of the HITRUST
      CSF, including without limitation any modification, enhancement,
      translation, compilation, expansion, or any other form in which the
      HITRUST CSF may be recast or adapted, and that, if prepared without
      HITRUST’s authorization, would constitute an infringement or violation of
      HITRUST’s rights.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These prohibitions shall not apply to: Any information, compilation, method,
    technique, procedure, or process included in the HITRUST CSF that (a) is or

    HITRUST makes available under this License Agreement, and any derivatives
    thereof, may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States

      >11. Defense of Infringement and Misappropriation Claims.</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">11.1. Notice and Cure.</strong> In the event that
    HITRUST receives notice that the HITRUST CSF, or any component of the
    HITRUST CSF, may infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or constitute a
    misappropriation of a trade secret, HITRUST may, at its sole discretion:
  </p>
  <ul class="number-list">
    <li>
      Procure for the Licensee the right to continue using the potentially or
      allegedly infringing or misappropriated component; or
    </li>
    <li>
      Modify the HITRUST CSF to provide, or substitute, materially equivalent
      functioning or a materially functional equivalent which does not infringe
      and/or is not misappropriated in which case the Licensee shall immediately
      stop using the allegedly infringing or misappropriated component and shall
      cooperate with HITRUST in implementing use of the functional substitute.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">11.2. Limited Defense.</strong> HITRUST will defend
    the Licensee against any claims by an unaffiliated third party that any
    component of the HITRUST CSF infringes any copyright, trademark or patent or
    misappropriates any trade secret, including but not limited to an action for
    injunctive relief based on such a claim; on the condition precedent that the
    Licensee gives HITRUST prompt written notice of such claim, gives HITRUST
    sole control over its defense or settlement (except that HITRUST may not
    settle any such claim against Licensee unless it unconditionally releases
    Licensee of all liability), and provides HITRUST with reasonable assistance
    and cooperation in such defense. Defense to any other claims shall not be
    provided, and issues relating to defense coverage shall be resolved in the
    sole and absolute discretion of HITRUST.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">11.3. Limitation of Duty to Defend.</strong> HITRUST
    shall have no obligation to defend the Licensee against any claim:
  </p>
  <ul class="number-list">
    <li>
      That relates to an allegedly infringing use, or use of misappropriated
      intellectual property, after HITRUST has notified the Licensee of a
      substitute as provided above; or
    </li>
    <li>
      That relates to any use or disclosure of any portion of the HITRUST CSF,
      in whole or in part, in breach of any term of this License Agreement; or
    </li>
    <li>
      For any trade secret claim that arises from the Licensee acquiring the
      trade secret through improper means, under conditions giving rise to a
      duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use, or from a person other than
      Licensee who owed the party asserting the claim a duty to maintain the
      secrecy or limit the use of the trade secret.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong class="c-red">11.4. Exclusive Remedy.</strong> The rights and
    remedies stated in this Section 11 state Licensor’s entire liability and the
    sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee and its Affiliates with respect to any
    claim of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property
    rights of any third party, whether arising under statutory or common law or
    otherwise.
